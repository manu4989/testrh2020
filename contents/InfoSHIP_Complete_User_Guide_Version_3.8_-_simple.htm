This guide describes the software version 3.8, in which the standard installation is comprised of the following modules: Da correggere All the collected data is shown to the Officers through the installed Operational Dashboards, averaged on a five minutes basis and saved in the database for export ashore for further analysis. The Operational Dashboards, which are described in detail in the following chapters, show data regarding:Performance® also collects manual inputs through the Operational Dashboards regarding voyage data unobtainable from automation and navigation systems. Da correggere e aggiornare The software is designed to help the Captain and the Officers make operational decisions to save fuel during the daily management of the ship. It is intended to help by providing useful tips, and not to control or override the authority of the Captain and the Officers, especially regarding safety matters.  Da modificare (Distinguere Terra e Bordo) Performance®The data automatically collected and/or manually inserted are processed and displayed on the Operational Dashboards available on board and on shore. Values displayed on the Operational Dashboards on board are refreshed every 15 seconds. However, the raw data acquired from the automatic systems could be available to the Data Collector with a different frequency, this means that data are collected more slowly.The calculated information displayed in the pages TO (Trim Optimization) and PE (Propulsion Efficiency) are averaged on a 5 minutes basis to provide more stable and accurate information.The values displayed on the Operational Dashboards on shore are refreshed less frequently, depending on the satellite connection and the communication policies of the Company.

The Vessel Reporting functionality can be reached by clicking on the corresponding entry in the menu: That includes the following sub-entries:Company Reporting: here the user will be allowed to fillVessel Reporting reports that represent specific phases of the voyage, like Departure-Arrival-NoonShip Operation reports that represent specific operation performed during a voyage, like Bunker-Fuel Change Log Books: in this section, the user will be allowed to report Deck &amp; Engine Log Books (if needed) Embarkation: this section is strictly connected to the Log Books one; considering the Company’s procedures, a specific person/role will be allowed to manage the embarkation/dis-embarkation of the crew members considering the port and date-time of the activities. The person that will be recognized as “embarked” by Performance, will be allowed to fill in the information in the reportsMRV/IMO-DCS: the user, ashore and onboard, will be able to download MRV and IMO-DCS reports in PDF format All the mentioned reports will be filled onboard by the users that have the correct permissions set; all the reports will be visible also ashore.6.1 Company reportingWith the Company Reporting module, you can consult all reports that are manually inserted on board the vessels during any voyage to check that data has been inserted correctly. NOTE: The HQ Installation can see reports in read-only mode; changes cannot be made to reports from this Installation.     The Company Reporting menu entry consists of three sub-entries: Voyage Summary: here you will be able to visualize all the reports of each specific voyage Search: here you will be able to search for a specific type of reports during a period, or just simply search for all the reports that have been filled in in the period. It’s important to note that in Office you will also be able to search for any vessels of your fleetReports: the user will be allowed to download a specific report in PDF format (???) 6.1.1 Voyage Summary The Voyage Summary has the following look and feel: The Tool Bar contains the filtering options (that can be hid using )By Vessel , available only ashoreBy Voyage; the date shown represents the start date of each voyage Current  button will apply the “current” (or the latest) filtering option Apply  will confirm the filtering selectionFor example, here we have searched for the Voyage “Genova-Livorno” started on the 23 February 2021.   On the left of the screen you can see that the Voyage Summary has some data populated: same info can be manually edited; some others will be automatically populated during the compilation of the reports. On the right of the screen, you can see the list of the voyage reports (e.g. Departure and Arrival) and ship operations (e.g. Fuel Change) that have been filled in during the voyage. The list of reports shows the last report of the voyage on top. 6.1.2 SearchThe Search window appears as below The user can search the reports considering a specific period by clicking the calendar icon  and selecting the period, e.g. May 2021.To confirm the selection, just click Apply button on the right, the list of reports will appear in chronological order After the period definition, a new set of filters will be available linked to each column shown; this option can be activated simply clicking the second filtering icon.   The report selection can be refined as per user needs. 6.1.3 Reports The Reports window allows the user to download the printing copy of specific reports, selecting:Vessel(s), only available ashorePeriod of timeReport type 6.1.3.1 Opening the First Voyage  Now the user can click on “New” button to properly start the reporting action of the voyage. Vessel Reporting: here the user will see all the possible reports related to the voyage phases, e.g. Departure ReportShip Operations: here the user will see all the possible reports related to specific Ship Operations (onboard activities) It’s important to highlight that all the reports/forms are built on the Company’s specific needs; they can be obviously different considering different Companies and can also be different considering types of vessels managed inside the same Company. NOTE: All the forms are configurated considering the Company’s procedures; Performance will help users fill in the forms in the correct order showing the user only the report that can be filled in on the specific step of the Voyage Flow.  Open the Voyage SummaryClick on NewSelect Vessel ReportingSelect the Port report The higher section includes the header dataDate (UTC)Elapsed time since last report (automatically calculated by the system)Notes areaThe below section is split in different tabs and in each tab the user will be required to fill in different information (the information to be filled is defined considering Company’s needs and procedures)Voyage SummaryNewVessel ReportingSelect the report that needs to be compiledOpen Voyage SummarySelect the current voyageClick New and select Ship OperationsSelect the activity that needs to be compiled, e.g. Fuel BunkeringThe Ship Operation of Fuel Bunkering (the fuel’s list is directly linked to the fuel’s registry) will be openedThe user will need to fill in the correct Date (UTC) and add all the data related to the correct fuel. Click on “Save” button and the Ship Operation will be saved in the system.NOTE: Since the Ship Operations are not included in the Voyage Report sequence, they can be inserted and deleted at any time of the voyage. Keep in mind that some Ship Operation are strictly connected to the data reported during the voyage and enhance them (e.g. the fuel characteristics), so deleting or adding a Ship Operation when the voyage is already closed could require some modifications to be done in the Voyage Reports too.

This is how the landing page is presented:By clicking on the New button , the user will be prompted with a form where, with the system’s assistance, in three simple steps it’s possible to calibrate the inclinometer:Setup parameters phase – the following info should be filled in the systemDraft mark aftDraft mark foreLongitudinal distance between aft and fore marksCurrent read (deg)Current trim (m)Check that the current value of Trim is steady   ComputeCheck if the Calculated trim value is the expected value, please note that positive trim means bow downIf the values are satisfactory click on OK and saveAlso check on the Dashboard to see if the trim value is satisfactory there. If it is not, please repeat the procedure.In order to add screenshots for Compute and Done, I’d need an example of setup parameters. (Roberto Bardi)Note: the calibration needs the ship to be in still conditions, without loading or unloading anything (cargo, bunker, sludge…), with little wind or waves to obtain a very precise reading on the draft marks.  Application Parameters  Database Connections Export DataThe content of this gap must be redone on the account of recent changes of the version.Import Data Distribution queue UI Customizer Ship Live DashboardsNavigationThe Navigation Dashboard shows basic data from the bridge instrumentation and the loading condition of the ship.

Press the  button and select “Ship Operations”, which will lead the user to various options (e.g.: wind state observation, fuel change, etc.). Select the option where data must be added:Insert dataSubmit the new configuration Meteorological Sensors and ModelsThe wind state, sea state and sea current are acquired by the system from two alternative and automatic sources: Sensor and Model. Sensor means that:the ship’s instruments (e.g. anemometer), if interfaced, can provide both true and apparent wind data;the wind force measured by the anemometer could be converted to both true and apparent sea data.Model means that Performance installed on board receives regular weather updates about the area around the ship’s position from a web service:actual and forecasted true and apparent wind data;actual and forecasted true and apparent sea state;actual and forecasted true and apparent current.The user can select their preferred view in the Navigation panel by following these steps: click on the blue button in one of the frames (e.g. Wind blue frame as proposed in the picture below); a dropdown list will appearselect the desired value to be displayed between the proposed ones (e.g. as in the picture: True Sensor / Apparent Sensor / True Model / Apparent Model) Meteorological Temporary Manual InputsIn case that a known sensor for the Sea/Wind State is malfunctioning, or if there are big discrepancies between the automatic values and those observed, the user on board must advise the Company responsible for Performance. The manual input will have to be activated in order to ensure that the meteorological data related to the Sea/Wind State can be modified. To do this, please follow the procedure described in the paragraphs below.This temporary condition can be enabled until the sensor is serviced, or the model is improved. To manually input sea/wind state, see in this user guide: 10. Ship Live Dashboards &gt; 10.1 Navigation:NOTE: considering the high importance of the Sea State in the effectiveness of the calculations executed in Performance®, it’s strongly recommended to update its values every 4 hours when the ship is sailing. PropulsionThe Propulsion Dashboard shows the basic data related to the ship main propulsion.   The main data reported are:Shaft Power [kW] and Revolutions [rpm]; the values are shown also as % of the maximum power and revolutions of the engine (considering the builder’s engine specifications)Engine runningEngine SFOCShaft Generator Power, if availableEngine fuel consumptionEngine fuel in use and technical data (density, heat of combustion, sulphur %, water %)Pitch and Thrust, if availableShaft Generator MCR, if availableIf the vessel has more than one “main engine”, the data will be shown for each one of them.Main Engine Fuel ChangeThe fuel in use can be edited manually.  See in this user guide: 10. Ship Live Dashboards &gt; 10.1 Navigation.NOTE: if and when is possible, the software is filled with automatic detection data related to the fuel in use; please check the values after any fuel change and update only the technical data of the fuel if necessary.  GenerationThe Generation dashboard shows basic data related to electric generation.  The main data reported here are:DG Running and Power of each generator of the shipDG Group fuel consumptionDG Group SFOCDG fuel in use and technical dataReefers data; that information will be available depending on the type of the ship.

Propulsion EfficiencyOn the Propulsion Efficiency page, the current measurements, collected from the Data Collector, are shown, and the optimum values are calculated. Also, to better evaluate the efficiency, the offset between actual and target values is shown beneath the related index.In the figure shown below the measurements are:Hydrodynamic Efficiency data Actual and target slip [%]The Target Slip is calculated with a Black Box regression model and, immediately below the value, an indication of the model currently in use for calculations is reported for reference.Actual and target power [kW]The Actual Power is read using the torque meter(s).The Target Power is calculated based on a statistical algorithm which takes into account the actual speed (to determine the speed power curve to be used), the displacement and the sea conditions (automatically derived from ship’s system or manually filled in by the crew).  Below the Target value, the system reports the indication of the model currently in use for calculations.Fuel dataActual and Target Fuel Consumed [kg/h]The Actual Fuel Consumption is read directly from the flowmeter(s).The Target value is calculated starting from a speed consumption curve (considering the actual speed value) and applying a correction based on the actual displacement and sea conditions manually inserted by the crew.Thermodynamic Efficiency dataActual and Target Main Engine SFOCThe Actual value is calculated from the ratio of the actual values of the fuel consumed and propulsion power.The target value is obtained from a table given by the engine manufacturer that gives the correct value of SFOC given the actual MCR value.Other Operational valuesSystem reports in the present dashboard also other operational values used for calculations (with the source of the information); e.g. speed, displacement, sea direction, wind state… When is not possible to calculate the target values due to off-range input data, a message appears at the bottom of the page. Each index shows how far the actual value is from the target one and presents also a coloured semaphores indication:Green, means that no intervention is required on the systemYellow, means that the value is slightly far from the target oneRed, means that the value is far from the target and the efficiency of the voyage is decreasingGrey, when the ship is in PORT or MANOEUVRE phase, meaning that PE cannot be calculated.On the screenshot it’s visible how in this page, these semaphore indications do not appear. Asking test dept for screenshotsTarget Power and Target Fuel indexes are conditioned by the steadiness of the ship state: main engine power and the ship’s course can be considered as “steady” when their values’ variability is below a defined threshold. If the ship state is not steady, the indexes are deactivated, and a message appears at the bottom of the page. Trim Trim OptimizationThe Actual Trim measure is shown in the Trim Optimization page; it’s collected from the inclinometer, along with speed and displacement.If the optimum trim matrix is loaded in the software, the Optimum Trim is also shown along with a percentage of efficiency. The figure below shows the measurements included in the Trim Optimization dashboard (from left to right): Percentage of efficiency of the Actual Trim, the Current Trim and the Optimum TrimMeasurement history graph (Efficiency in red, Optimum Trim in green and Current Trim in blue).The time interval of the history could be set from a minimum of 30 minutes up to 8 hours before.In the last table the Actual Speed, Drafts and Displacement values are shown. Please be aware that a positive value of the trim means fore down. Note: the calculation is designed to suggest the best seagoing trim to reduce fuel consumption. Safety matters have priority and should be evaluated by the Captain separately as they are not included in the calculation. Static Trim Assistant Engine Load DiagramHere the system shows the actual operating point of the main engines.The number of diagrams on the page depends on the specific layout of the ship’s plants and sensors.  The curves reported in the graph are:Engine Load (red)Engine Limits (yellow)Light Running Propeller Curve (light blue)Engine Overload Limits (dark red)Nominal Propeller Curve (green)EPL curve – Engine Power Limitations (purple)The white dot reported in the graph explains how the engines are performing at the moment; with this indication, users can understand if the engines are performing well or not.The white dot is not present on the graph (either on the white or black presentations).

A ship may have the refrigeration system turned down, off, or up, depending on the phase of the voyage. This information is valuable because it helps you detect when you have a higher number of diesel generators running and what the reason for them running may be. If there are many reefers on board it makes sense that more power is requested. If there aren’t many reefers working and you are still consuming lots of power, you know you need to look into why.

The Vessel Reporting functionality can be reached by clicking on the corresponding entry in the menu: That includes the following sub-entries:Company Reporting: here the user will be allowed to fillVessel Reporting reports that represent specific phases of the voyage, like Departure-Arrival-NoonShip Operation reports that represent specific operation performed during a voyage, like Bunker-Fuel Change Log Books: in this section, the user will be allowed to report Deck &amp; Engine Log Books (if needed) Embarkation: this section is strictly connected to the Log Books one; considering the Company’s procedures, a specific person/role will be allowed to manage the embarkation/dis-embarkation of the crew members considering the port and date-time of the activities. The person that will be recognized as “embarked” by Performance, will be allowed to fill in the information in the reportsMRV/IMO-DCS: the user, ashore and onboard, will be able to download MRV and IMO-DCS reports in PDF format All the mentioned reports will be filled onboard by the users that have the correct permissions set; all the reports will be visible also ashore.6.1 Company reportingWith the Company Reporting module, you can consult all reports that are manually inserted on board the vessels during any voyage to check that data has been inserted correctly. NOTE: The HQ Installation can see reports in read-only mode; changes cannot be made to reports from this Installation.     The Company Reporting menu entry consists of three sub-entries: Voyage Summary: here you will be able to visualize all the reports of each specific voyage Search: here you will be able to search for a specific type of reports during a period, or just simply search for all the reports that have been filled in in the period. It’s important to note that in Office you will also be able to search for any vessels of your fleetReports: the user will be allowed to download a specific report in PDF format (???) 6.1.1 Voyage Summary The Voyage Summary has the following look and feel: The Tool Bar contains the filtering options (that can be hid using )By Vessel , available only ashoreBy Voyage; the date shown represents the start date of each voyage Current  button will apply the “current” (or the latest) filtering option Apply  will confirm the filtering selectionFor example, here we have searched for the Voyage “Genova-Livorno” started on the 23 February 2021.   On the left of the screen you can see that the Voyage Summary has some data populated: same info can be manually edited; some others will be automatically populated during the compilation of the reports. On the right of the screen, you can see the list of the voyage reports (e.g. Departure and Arrival) and ship operations (e.g. Fuel Change) that have been filled in during the voyage. The list of reports shows the last report of the voyage on top. 6.1.2 SearchThe Search window appears as below The user can search the reports considering a specific period by clicking the calendar icon  and selecting the period, e.g. May 2021.To confirm the selection, just click Apply button on the right, the list of reports will appear in chronological order After the period definition, a new set of filters will be available linked to each column shown; this option can be activated simply clicking the second filtering icon.   The report selection can be refined as per user needs. 6.1.3 Reports The Reports window allows the user to download the printing copy of specific reports, selecting:Vessel(s), only available ashorePeriod of timeReport type 6.1.3.1 Opening the First Voyage  Now the user can click on “New” button to properly start the reporting action of the voyage. Vessel Reporting: here the user will see all the possible reports related to the voyage phases, e.g. Departure ReportShip Operations: here the user will see all the possible reports related to specific Ship Operations (onboard activities) It’s important to highlight that all the reports/forms are built on the Company’s specific needs; they can be obviously different considering different Companies and can also be different considering types of vessels managed inside the same Company. NOTE: All the forms are configurated considering the Company’s procedures; Performance will help users fill in the forms in the correct order showing the user only the report that can be filled in on the specific step of the Voyage Flow.  Open the Voyage SummaryClick on NewSelect Vessel ReportingSelect the Port report The higher section includes the header dataDate (UTC)Elapsed time since last report (automatically calculated by the system)Notes areaThe below section is split in different tabs and in each tab the user will be required to fill in different information (the information to be filled is defined considering Company’s needs and procedures)Voyage SummaryNewVessel ReportingSelect the report that needs to be compiledOpen Voyage SummarySelect the current voyageClick New and select Ship OperationsSelect the activity that needs to be compiled, e.g. Fuel BunkeringThe Ship Operation of Fuel Bunkering (the fuel’s list is directly linked to the fuel’s registry) will be openedThe user will need to fill in the correct Date (UTC) and add all the data related to the correct fuel. Click on “Save” button and the Ship Operation will be saved in the system.NOTE: Since the Ship Operations are not included in the Voyage Report sequence, they can be inserted and deleted at any time of the voyage. Keep in mind that some Ship Operation are strictly connected to the data reported during the voyage and enhance them (e.g. the fuel characteristics), so deleting or adding a Ship Operation when the voyage is already closed could require some modifications to be done in the Voyage Reports too.

This is how the landing page is presented:By clicking on the New button , the user will be prompted with a form where, with the system’s assistance, in three simple steps it’s possible to calibrate the inclinometer:Setup parameters phase – the following info should be filled in the systemDraft mark aftDraft mark foreLongitudinal distance between aft and fore marksCurrent read (deg)Current trim (m)Check that the current value of Trim is steady   ComputeCheck if the Calculated trim value is the expected value, please note that positive trim means bow downIf the values are satisfactory click on OK and saveAlso check on the Dashboard to see if the trim value is satisfactory there. If it is not, please repeat the procedure.In order to add screenshots for Compute and Done, I’d need an example of setup parameters. (Roberto Bardi)Note: the calibration needs the ship to be in still conditions, without loading or unloading anything (cargo, bunker, sludge…), with little wind or waves to obtain a very precise reading on the draft marks.

Press the  button and select “Ship Operations”, which will lead the user to various options (e.g.: wind state observation, fuel change, etc.). Select the option where data must be added:Insert dataSubmit the new configuration Meteorological Sensors and ModelsThe wind state, sea state and sea current are acquired by the system from two alternative and automatic sources: Sensor and Model. Sensor means that:the ship’s instruments (e.g. anemometer), if interfaced, can provide both true and apparent wind data;the wind force measured by the anemometer could be converted to both true and apparent sea data.Model means that Performance installed on board receives regular weather updates about the area around the ship’s position from a web service:actual and forecasted true and apparent wind data;actual and forecasted true and apparent sea state;actual and forecasted true and apparent current.The user can select their preferred view in the Navigation panel by following these steps: click on the blue button in one of the frames (e.g. Wind blue frame as proposed in the picture below); a dropdown list will appearselect the desired value to be displayed between the proposed ones (e.g. as in the picture: True Sensor / Apparent Sensor / True Model / Apparent Model) Meteorological Temporary Manual InputsIn case that a known sensor for the Sea/Wind State is malfunctioning, or if there are big discrepancies between the automatic values and those observed, the user on board must advise the Company responsible for Performance. The manual input will have to be activated in order to ensure that the meteorological data related to the Sea/Wind State can be modified. To do this, please follow the procedure described in the paragraphs below.This temporary condition can be enabled until the sensor is serviced, or the model is improved. To manually input sea/wind state, see in this user guide: 10. Ship Live Dashboards &gt; 10.1 Navigation:NOTE: considering the high importance of the Sea State in the effectiveness of the calculations executed in Performance®, it’s strongly recommended to update its values every 4 hours when the ship is sailing. PropulsionThe Propulsion Dashboard shows the basic data related to the ship main propulsion.   The main data reported are:Shaft Power [kW] and Revolutions [rpm]; the values are shown also as % of the maximum power and revolutions of the engine (considering the builder’s engine specifications)Engine runningEngine SFOCShaft Generator Power, if availableEngine fuel consumptionEngine fuel in use and technical data (density, heat of combustion, sulphur %, water %)Pitch and Thrust, if availableShaft Generator MCR, if availableIf the vessel has more than one “main engine”, the data will be shown for each one of them.Main Engine Fuel ChangeThe fuel in use can be edited manually.  See in this user guide: 10. Ship Live Dashboards &gt; 10.1 Navigation.NOTE: if and when is possible, the software is filled with automatic detection data related to the fuel in use; please check the values after any fuel change and update only the technical data of the fuel if necessary.  GenerationThe Generation dashboard shows basic data related to electric generation.

Propulsion EfficiencyOn the Propulsion Efficiency page, the current measurements, collected from the Data Collector, are shown, and the optimum values are calculated. Also, to better evaluate the efficiency, the offset between actual and target values is shown beneath the related index.In the figure shown below the measurements are:Hydrodynamic Efficiency data Actual and target slip [%]The Target Slip is calculated with a Black Box regression model and, immediately below the value, an indication of the model currently in use for calculations is reported for reference.Actual and target power [kW]The Actual Power is read using the torque meter(s).The Target Power is calculated based on a statistical algorithm which takes into account the actual speed (to determine the speed power curve to be used), the displacement and the sea conditions (automatically derived from ship’s system or manually filled in by the crew).  Below the Target value, the system reports the indication of the model currently in use for calculations.Fuel dataActual and Target Fuel Consumed [kg/h]The Actual Fuel Consumption is read directly from the flowmeter(s).The Target value is calculated starting from a speed consumption curve (considering the actual speed value) and applying a correction based on the actual displacement and sea conditions manually inserted by the crew.Thermodynamic Efficiency dataActual and Target Main Engine SFOCThe Actual value is calculated from the ratio of the actual values of the fuel consumed and propulsion power.The target value is obtained from a table given by the engine manufacturer that gives the correct value of SFOC given the actual MCR value.Other Operational valuesSystem reports in the present dashboard also other operational values used for calculations (with the source of the information); e.g. speed, displacement, sea direction, wind state… When is not possible to calculate the target values due to off-range input data, a message appears at the bottom of the page. Each index shows how far the actual value is from the target one and presents also a coloured semaphores indication:Green, means that no intervention is required on the systemYellow, means that the value is slightly far from the target oneRed, means that the value is far from the target and the efficiency of the voyage is decreasingGrey, when the ship is in PORT or MANOEUVRE phase, meaning that PE cannot be calculated.On the screenshot it’s visible how in this page, these semaphore indications do not appear. Asking test dept for screenshotsTarget Power and Target Fuel indexes are conditioned by the steadiness of the ship state: main engine power and the ship’s course can be considered as “steady” when their values’ variability is below a defined threshold. If the ship state is not steady, the indexes are deactivated, and a message appears at the bottom of the page. Trim Trim OptimizationThe Actual Trim measure is shown in the Trim Optimization page; it’s collected from the inclinometer, along with speed and displacement.If the optimum trim matrix is loaded in the software, the Optimum Trim is also shown along with a percentage of efficiency. The figure below shows the measurements included in the Trim Optimization dashboard (from left to right): Percentage of efficiency of the Actual Trim, the Current Trim and the Optimum TrimMeasurement history graph (Efficiency in red, Optimum Trim in green and Current Trim in blue).The time interval of the history could be set from a minimum of 30 minutes up to 8 hours before.In the last table the Actual Speed, Drafts and Displacement values are shown. Please be aware that a positive value of the trim means fore down. Note: the calculation is designed to suggest the best seagoing trim to reduce fuel consumption. Safety matters have priority and should be evaluated by the Captain separately as they are not included in the calculation. Static Trim Assistant Engine Load DiagramHere the system shows the actual operating point of the main engines.The number of diagrams on the page depends on the specific layout of the ship’s plants and sensors.  The curves reported in the graph are:Engine Load (red)Engine Limits (yellow)Light Running Propeller Curve (light blue)Engine Overload Limits (dark red)Nominal Propeller Curve (green)EPL curve – Engine Power Limitations (purple)The white dot reported in the graph explains how the engines are performing at the moment; with this indication, users can understand if the engines are performing well or not.The white dot is not present on the graph (either on the white or black presentations).
